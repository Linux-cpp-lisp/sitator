class MergeSitesByBarrier(MergeSites):
    """Merge sites based on the energy barrier between them.

    Uses a cheap coordinate driving system; this may not be sophisticated enough
    for complex cases. For each pair of sites within the pairwise distance cutoff,
    a linear spatial interpolation is applied to produce `n_driven_images`.
    Two sites are considered mergable if their energies are within
    `final_initial_energy_threshold` and the barrier between them is below
    `barrier_threshold`. The barrier is defined as the maximum image energy minus
    the average of the initial and final energy.

    The energies of the mobile atom are calculated in a static lattice given
    by `coordinating_mask`; if `None`, this is set to the systems `static_mask`.

    For resonable performance, `calculator` should be something simple like
    `ase.calculators.lj.LennardJones`.

    Takes species of first mobile atom as mobile species.

    Args:
        - calculator (ase.Calculator): For computing total potential energies.
        - barrier_threshold (float, eV): The barrier value above which two sites
            are not mergable.
        - n_driven_images (int, default: None): The number of evenly distributed
            driven images to use.
        - maximum_pairwise_distance (float, Angstrom): The maximum distance
            between two sites for them to be considered for merging.
        - minimum_jumps_mergable (int): The minimum number of observed jumps
            between two sites for their merging to be considered. Setting this
            higher can avoid unnecessary computations.
        - maximum_merge_distance (float, Angstrom): The maxiumum pairwise distance
            among a group of sites chosed to be merged.
