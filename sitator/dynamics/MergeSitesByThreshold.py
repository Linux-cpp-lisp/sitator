class MergeSitesByThreshold(MergeSites):
    """Merge sites using a strict threshold on any edge property.

    Takes the edge property matrix given by `attrname`, applys `relation` to it
    with `threshold`, and merges all connected components in the graph represented
    by the resulting boolean adjacency matrix.

    Threshold is given by a keyword argument to `run()`.

    Args:
        - attrname (str): Name of the edge attribute to merge on.
        - relation (func, default: operator.ge): The relation to use for the
            thresholding.
        - directed, connection (bool, str): Parameters for scipy.sparse.csgraph's
            `connected_components`.
