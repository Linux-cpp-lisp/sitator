# sitator

Advanced site analysis for molecular dynamics trajectories.

## Installation

`sitator` depends on [Zeo++](http://www.maciejharanczyk.info/Zeopp/examples.html) for the Voronoi decomposition.

For site type analysis, a working installation of [Quippy](https://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/) with [GAP](http://www.libatoms.org/gap/gap_download.html) is also required for computing SOAP descriptors.
